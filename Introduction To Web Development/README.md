### How Website Works ?
Computers connected to the internet are called clients and servers. A simplified diagram of how they interact might look like this:

Clients are the typical web user's internet-connected devices (for example, your computer connected to your Wi-Fi, or your phone connected to your mobile network) and web-accessing software available on those devices (usually a web browser like Firefox or Chrome).

Servers are computers that store webpages, sites, or apps. When a client device wants to access a webpage, a copy of the webpage is downloaded from the server onto the client machine to be displayed in the user's web browser.

1. Every client and server have an ip address on internet
2. When client go to www.example.com, client will create dns query to determine what server ip
3. Client send request to server with ip from dns query
4. Server send response to client, the web browser will render html,css,js file from server
